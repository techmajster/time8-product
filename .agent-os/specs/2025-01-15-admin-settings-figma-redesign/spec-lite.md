# Spec Summary (Lite)

Redesign the admin settings page to align with Figma designs, reducing from 8 tabs to 4 tabs (Ogólne, Tryb pracy, Urlopy, Rozliczenia) while removing deprecated features and updating the UI to match the new design system. The Tryb pracy tab will include visual-only working days grid and work hours selectors, and the Urlopy tab will be simplified to a single table view without nested tabs.
