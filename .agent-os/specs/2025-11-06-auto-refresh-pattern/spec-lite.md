# Spec Summary (Lite)

Implement a consistent event-driven auto-refresh system across all pages to eliminate manual page reloads and provide seamless data updates after mutations. Create a unified event system with helper functions, then integrate it across team management, settings, and leave request pages to replace `window.location.reload()` and `router.refresh()` calls with automatic refetch functionality.
