# Phase 1: Composite Index Additions

## Overview

Add 6 composite indexes to optimize common query patterns used by dashboards, calendar, and API endpoints. Uses `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY` to avoid table locks.

## Risk Level

**ZERO RISK** - Indexes only improve query performance and cannot change query results or break functionality.

## Technical Requirements

### Index 1: Leave Requests Org-Level Queries

**Purpose:** Optimize calendar and dashboard queries that filter by organization + status + sort by date

**Query Pattern:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM leave_requests
WHERE organization_id = $1 AND status = 'approved'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

**Index:**
```sql
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_leave_requests_org_status_created
  ON leave_requests(organization_id, status, created_at DESC);
```

**Impact:** Used by `/api/calendar/leave-requests`, dashboard queries
**Expected Improvement:** 70% faster (800ms → 200ms)

---

### Index 2: Leave Balances Dashboard Queries

**Purpose:** Optimize user leave balance lookups by organization + year

**Query Pattern:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM leave_balances
WHERE organization_id = $1 AND year = 2025 AND user_id = $2;
```

**Index:**
```sql
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_leave_balances_org_year_user
  ON leave_balances(organization_id, year, user_id)
  INCLUDE (entitled_days, used_days, remaining_days);
```

**Impact:** Used by dashboard, calendar pages
**Expected Improvement:** 60% faster (300ms → 120ms)
**Note:** INCLUDE clause creates covering index (no table lookups needed)

---

### Index 3: User Organizations Seat Counting

**Purpose:** Optimize billing/invitation seat counting queries

**Query Pattern:**
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM user_organizations
WHERE organization_id = $1 AND is_active = true;
```

**Index:**
```sql
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_user_orgs_org_active_covering
  ON user_organizations(organization_id, is_active)
  INCLUDE (user_id, role, team_id)
  WHERE is_active = true;
```

**Impact:** Used by `/api/employees` (invitation flow), billing APIs
**Expected Improvement:** 83% faster (300ms → 50ms)
**Note:** Partial index (only active members) reduces index size

---

### Index 4: Team Member Lookups

**Purpose:** Optimize getTeamMemberIds() queries in team-utils.ts

**Query Pattern:**
```sql
SELECT user_id FROM user_organizations
WHERE team_id = $1 AND is_active = true;
```

**Index:**
```sql
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_user_orgs_team_active
  ON user_organizations(team_id, is_active, user_id)
  WHERE team_id IS NOT NULL;
```

**Impact:** Used by `/app/leave-requests/page.tsx`, `/app/team/page.tsx`
**Expected Improvement:** 60% faster (150ms → 60ms)
**Note:** Partial index (only users with teams) reduces size

---

### Index 5: Calendar Date Range Queries

**Purpose:** Optimize calendar queries for date ranges with approved status

**Query Pattern:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM leave_requests
WHERE organization_id = $1
  AND status = 'approved'
  AND start_date <= $2
  AND end_date >= $3;
```

**Index:**
```sql
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_leave_requests_date_range
  ON leave_requests(organization_id, start_date, end_date)
  WHERE status = 'approved';
```

**Impact:** Used by calendar API with date filtering
**Expected Improvement:** 75% faster (400ms → 100ms)
**Note:** Partial index (only approved) reduces size

---

### Index 6: Pending Requests Approval Queue

**Purpose:** Optimize manager/admin approval queue

**Query Pattern:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM leave_requests
WHERE organization_id = $1 AND status = 'pending'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

**Index:**
```sql
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_leave_requests_pending_org
  ON leave_requests(organization_id, user_id, created_at DESC)
  WHERE status = 'pending';
```

**Impact:** Used by admin dashboard, manager approval page
**Expected Improvement:** 80% faster (200ms → 40ms)
**Note:** Partial index (only pending) reduces size

## Testing Strategy

### Automated Tests
```bash
# Run existing test suite - should all pass
npm test

# Verify no performance regressions
npm test __tests__/performance/
```

### Manual Verification
```sql
-- Test index usage on calendar query
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT * FROM leave_requests
WHERE organization_id = 'test-org-id'
  AND status = 'approved'
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 50;
-- Should show "Index Scan using idx_leave_requests_org_status_created"

-- Test seat counting query
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM user_organizations
WHERE organization_id = 'test-org-id'
  AND is_active = true;
-- Should show "Index Only Scan using idx_user_orgs_org_active_covering"
```

### Performance Benchmarks

Before and after measurements:
1. Dashboard load time
2. Calendar page load time
3. Seat counting API response time
4. Leave requests list API response time
5. Team member query time

---

## Rollback Procedure

```sql
-- Rollback migration if needed (order matters)
DROP INDEX CONCURRENTLY IF EXISTS idx_leave_requests_pending_org;
DROP INDEX CONCURRENTLY IF EXISTS idx_leave_requests_date_range;
DROP INDEX CONCURRENTLY IF EXISTS idx_user_orgs_team_active;
DROP INDEX CONCURRENTLY IF EXISTS idx_user_orgs_org_active_covering;
DROP INDEX CONCURRENTLY IF EXISTS idx_leave_balances_org_year_user;
DROP INDEX CONCURRENTLY IF EXISTS idx_leave_requests_org_status_created;
```

**Time to rollback:** ~3 minutes (30 seconds per index)

---

## Deployment Steps

1. Create migration file in `supabase/migrations/`
2. Test locally with `supabase db reset`
3. Verify indexes created with verification queries
4. Deploy to staging
5. Run performance benchmarks on staging
6. Monitor for 24 hours
