# Spec Summary (Lite)

Fix critical bug where employee leave approver assignments are not saving to database when edited through admin interface. Update team management table to match Figma design by showing approver column instead of team manager, adding status badges, and removing leave balance columns. Add validation to require approver selection and prevent managers from self-approving (admins can self-approve for auto-approval).
