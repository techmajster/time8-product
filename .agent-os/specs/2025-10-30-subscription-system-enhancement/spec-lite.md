# Spec Summary (Lite)

Complete LemonSqueezy subscription integration by adding missing webhook handlers (payment_failed, paused, resumed), UI displays for trial and expired statuses, and trial countdown with conversion prompts. This ensures all subscription states are captured from LemonSqueezy and properly displayed in the app, preventing payment failures and service disruptions from going unnoticed.
