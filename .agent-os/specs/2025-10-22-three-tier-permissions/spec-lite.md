# Spec Summary (Lite)

Implement a three-tier permission system (Normal User, Manager, Admin) with role-based access control. Normal users access only their own data, managers have READ-ONLY access to Team/Groups plus leave management capabilities, and admins have full CRUD access across the entire workspace.
