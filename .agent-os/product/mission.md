## The Problem

### Manual Leave Management Inefficiency

Companies with 3+ employees struggle with manual leave tracking through spreadsheets or email, leading to scheduling conflicts and administrative overhead. Studies show that manual processes increase HR workload by 40% and cause 25% more scheduling conflicts.

**Our Solution:** Automated leave management with intelligent conflict detection and capacity planning.

### Multi-Organization Complexity

Growing businesses often manage multiple entities, subsidiaries, or departments but lack unified systems for cross-organizational leave coordination. This creates data silos and inconsistent policies.

**Our Solution:** Native multi-organization architecture with centralized management and flexible permission structures.

### Limited Team Visibility

Managers lack real-time insight into team availability, making project planning and resource allocation difficult, especially in shift-based or flexible work environments.

**Our Solution:** Real-time availability dashboards with advanced scheduling and capacity forecasting.

## Differentiators

### Multi-Organization Native Design

Unlike traditional leave management tools that bolt-on multi-tenancy, we built multi-organization support from the ground up. This results in seamless cross-organization workflows and simplified administration for growing businesses.

### Freemium with Smart Scaling

Unlike expensive enterprise solutions, we provide core functionality free for up to 3 users (admin + 2 employees), with transparent subscription scaling. This results in accessible adoption for small businesses with clear growth paths.

### Pixel-Perfect Modern Experience

Unlike legacy HR software with outdated interfaces, we leverage modern design systems (Figma + Shadcn) for pixel-perfect, mobile-responsive experiences. This results in higher user adoption and reduced training overhead.
