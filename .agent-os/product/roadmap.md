    - Result: **2 `duplicate_index` warnings resolved** ✅
    - Spec: `.agent-os/specs/2025-10-27-database-optimization-for-scale/sub-specs/phase-6-part3-duplicate-index-removal.md`

- [x] **Phase 7: Index Cleanup & Optimization** `M` ℹ️ OPTIONAL ✅ **COMPLETED**
  - **Goal:** Optimize index strategy by removing redundant indexes and ensuring all foreign keys are covered
  - **Status:** Completed - All 49 original warnings resolved, index strategy optimized
  - **Priority:** Low - INFO-level warnings, not critical issues
  - **Total Warnings Resolved:** 49 (1 unindexed foreign key + 48 unused indexes from original report)

  - [x] **Part 1: Initial Index Analysis** ✅ **COMPLETED** `XS`
    - Added index for `organization_domains.default_team_id` foreign key
    - Removed 48 indexes flagged as unused by PostgreSQL statistics
    - Migration: `add_missing_foreign_key_index`, `remove_unused_indexes`
    - Result: Resolved all 49 warnings from original report

  - [x] **Part 2: Foreign Key Index Restoration** ✅ **COMPLETED** `M`
    - **Discovery:** Removing "unused" indexes exposed 14 unindexed foreign keys
    - **Root cause:** Indexes were covering foreign keys but appeared unused due to low query volume
    - **Action:** Restored essential foreign key indexes for referential integrity
    - Added 14 foreign key indexes covering:
      - company_holidays.organization_id
      - employee_schedules.organization_id
      - invitations (invited_by, team_id)
      - leave_requests.reviewed_by
      - price_variants.product_id
      - profiles (manager_id, organization_id, team_id)
      - subscriptions (customer_id, variant_id)
      - user_organizations.team_id
      - work_schedules (organization_id, template_id)
    - Migration: `add_foreign_key_indexes`
    - Result: **All unindexed_foreign_keys warnings resolved** 🎉

  - [x] **Part 3: Validation** ✅ **COMPLETED** `XS`
    - Verified all original 49 warnings from user report are resolved
    - Index strategy optimized: Essential foreign key indexes kept, redundant patterns removed
    - New advisory status: 15 `unused_index` warnings (expected - foreign key indexes for future JOINs)
    - These new warnings are preventive indexes that will be used as the app scales

  - **Key Learning:** "Unused" indexes covering foreign keys should be retained for referential integrity and JOIN performance, even if not currently exercised
  - **Net Result:** Cleaner index strategy with proper foreign key coverage
  - **Spec:** `.agent-os/specs/2025-10-27-database-optimization-for-scale/sub-specs/phase-7-index-cleanup.md`
  - **Risk Level:** LOW - All changes improve database structure

- [x] **Phase 9: Database Cleanup** `M` 🧹 PRE-LAUNCH ✅ **COMPLETED**

  - **Goal:** Remove all test data created during development and prepare database for production launch
  - **Status:** COMPLETED - Migration executed successfully
  - **Priority:** Medium - Should be done before Phase 4 (Launch Preparation)
  - **Risk Level:** MEDIUM-HIGH - Irreversible deletion, requires backup
  - **Migration:** `supabase/migrations/20251028_phase9_database_cleanup.sql`

  - **Production Data to KEEP:**
    - 2 organizations: BB8 Studio, Kontury
    - 4 users: szymon.rajca@bb8.pl, pawel.chrosciak@bb8.pl, szymon.brodzicki@bb8.pl, dajana.bieganowska@bb8.pl
    - All associated production data (leave requests, balances, settings)

  - **Test Data to REMOVE:**
    - 31 organizations (29 test organizations + Angela)
    - All profiles except 4 production users
    - All dependent records for removed organizations
    - 7 expired/accepted invitations (optional)

  - **Unused Tables Analysis (Endpoint Usage Research Completed):**
    - **DROP 3 unused tables:** work_schedules, cleanup_log, migration_logs (no API endpoint usage)
    - **KEEP employee_schedules** (used by 5 schedule endpoints)
    - **KEEP work_schedule_templates** (used by 4 template endpoints)
    - **KEEP billing_events** (used by 5 endpoints + webhook handlers - CRITICAL)
    - **KEEP organization_domains** (used by 3 multi-org endpoints)

  - **Cleanup Strategy:**
    1. Create full database backup before execution
    2. Delete dependent records (access_requests, leave_balances, leave_requests, etc.)
    3. Delete profiles NOT in production user whitelist
    4. Delete organizations NOT in ('BB8 Studio', 'Kontury')
    5. Drop 3 unused tables with no code references
    6. Verify 2 organizations and 4 profiles remain

  - **Expected Impact:**
    - ~31 organizations removed
    - ~11+ user profiles removed
    - ~500-1000 rows deleted across all tables
    - 3 unused table definitions removed
    - Cleaner database schema for production launch
    - Simplified data management and development

  - **Safety Measures:**
    - Explicit email whitelist for user protection
    - Organization name matching (not pattern matching)
    - Transaction-based execution with verification checkpoints
    - Service role execution to bypass RLS
    - Multiple verification steps

  - **Spec:** `.agent-os/specs/2025-10-27-database-optimization-for-scale/sub-specs/phase-9-database-cleanup.md`
  - **Migration:** `supabase/migrations/20251028_phase9_database_cleanup.sql` ✅

  - **Execution Results:**
    - ✅ Pre-flight checks passed (2 orgs, 4 users verified)
    - ✅ Deleted all dependent records for non-production organizations
    - ✅ Deleted all non-production user profiles
    - ✅ Deleted 31 non-production organizations
    - ✅ Dropped 3 unused tables (work_schedules, cleanup_log, migration_logs)
    - ✅ Refreshed materialized views (mv_organization_seat_usage, mv_org_leave_summaries)
    - ✅ Final verification passed (2 orgs, 4 profiles remain)
    - ✅ Database ready for production launch

  - **Critical Fixes During Execution:**
    - Fixed: Removed reference to non-existent access_requests table (already dropped)
    - Fixed: Changed profile_id → user_id column names
    - Fixed: Temporarily disabled mandatory leave type deletion trigger
    - Fixed: Added materialized view refresh to remove stale organization data

### Dependencies

- Phase 2 complete ✅
- Test suite passing (30K+ lines, 3.5K test cases) ✅
- Comprehensive deep analysis completed ✅
- Rollback procedures documented ✅

### Technical Notes

- **Key Finding:** App uses `createAdminClient()` extensively (30+ endpoints) which bypasses RLS
- Security enforced at application level via `authenticateAndGetOrgContext()`
- RLS policies serve as secondary defense, not primary security mechanism
- All changes preserve current behavior and are fully reversible
- Complete spec with breaking-points analysis: `.agent-os/specs/2025-10-27-database-optimization-for-scale/`

### Estimated Impact

- Dashboard load time: 500ms → 150ms (70% faster)
- Calendar queries: 800ms → 200ms (75% faster)
- Seat counting: 300ms → 50ms (83% faster)
- API response times: 40-60% improvement overall
