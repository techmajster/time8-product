## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Deploy Database Migration

**Option A: Using Supabase Dashboard (Recommended)**
1. Go to your Supabase project: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/odbjrxsbgvmohdnvjjil
2. Navigate to: SQL Editor
3. Create new query
4. Copy contents of `supabase/migrations/20251028104841_create_notifications_system.sql`
5. Paste and run the migration
6. Verify success (should see "Success. No rows returned")

**Option B: Using Supabase CLI (if installed)**
```bash
supabase db push
```

### Step 2: Verify Migration Success

Check that the following were created:
- ‚úÖ Table: `notifications`
- ‚úÖ Indexes: 3 indexes (user_org_created, user_unread, leave_request)
- ‚úÖ RLS Policies: 3 policies (SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT)
- ‚úÖ Triggers: 2 triggers on `leave_requests` table
- ‚úÖ Functions: 2 trigger functions

### Step 3: Test the Feature

**3.1 Test Notification Creation (Automatic via Triggers)**

Create a test leave request and approve/reject it:
1. Login as an employee
2. Submit a leave request
3. Login as a manager/admin
4. Approve or reject the request
5. Login back as the employee
6. You should see the bell icon with a badge count

**3.2 Test Notification UI**

1. Click the bell icon
2. Sheet should open from the right side
3. Notifications should display with:
   - Blue background for unread
   - White background for read
   - Proper icons (Check, X, Info)
   - "Szczeg√≥≈Çy" button

**3.3 Test Navigation**

1. Click "Szczeg√≥≈Çy" on any notification
2. Should navigate to leave request detail view
3. Notification should be marked as read
4. Badge count should decrement

**3.4 Test Manager Notifications**

1. As an employee, submit a new leave request
2. As a manager, check the notification bell
3. Should see "Nowy wniosek urlopowy" notification
4. Click "Szczeg√≥≈Çy" to view the request

## üß™ Testing Checklist

- [ ] Migration deployed successfully
- [ ] Notifications table created with correct schema
- [ ] Employee receives "Urlop zaakceptowany" notification
- [ ] Employee receives "Urlop odrzucony" notification
- [ ] Manager receives "Nowy wniosek urlopowy" notification
- [ ] Bell icon displays unread count badge
- [ ] Sheet opens with proper styling (matches Figma)
- [ ] Unread notifications have blue-50 background
- [ ] Read notifications have white background
- [ ] "Szczeg√≥≈Çy" button navigates correctly
- [ ] Notification marked as read on click
- [ ] Badge count updates correctly
- [ ] Multi-tenant isolation works (users only see own notifications)

---

## üé® UI Verification

Verify the UI matches the Figma design:
- Bell icon in header (right side)
- Red badge with unread count
- Sheet width: 560px
- Header: "Powiadomienia" + badge
- Notification cards with proper spacing
- Footer: "Zamknij" button

---

## üìä Performance Checks

After deployment, monitor:
- API response times (<200ms expected)
- Database query performance (indexes should optimize queries)
- Polling interval working (30 seconds)
- No console errors

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

**Issue: No notifications appearing**
- Check database triggers are attached: `SELECT * FROM pg_trigger WHERE tgname LIKE 'trigger_notify%'`
- Verify RLS policies allow SELECT: Check user can query notifications table

**Issue: Badge count not updating**
- Check browser console for API errors
- Verify `/api/notifications` endpoint returns data
- Check polling interval is running

**Issue: Navigation not working**
- Verify `related_leave_request_id` is populated in notifications
- Check leave request detail page accepts `?detail=` parameter

**Issue: "Forbidden" errors**
- Verify user has active organization membership
- Check RLS policies are correct
- Ensure user_id matches authenticated user

---

## üéâ What's Next?

After successful deployment and testing:

1. **Optional Enhancements** (Phase 2):
   - Add Supabase Realtime for instant updates
   - Add "Mark all as read" button in sheet header
   - Add notification settings (email preferences)
   - Add push notifications for mobile

2. **Update Roadmap**:
   - Mark Phase 3 "In-App Notifications System" as complete

3. **Documentation**:
   - Update user documentation with notification feature
   - Add screenshots to help docs

---

## üìù Notes

- Notifications are never deleted (only marked as read)
- Database triggers run automatically (no code changes needed)
- Polling happens every 30 seconds when bell is visible
- All components use existing shadcn/ui library (no new dependencies)

---
